## Atoms

Think of atoms as storage containers each container has its own definite set of properties (key, default etc).

```js
import { atom, useBlitzState } from '@dimensionhq/blitz';

const todoState = atom([]);

// for setting todos you can use useBlitzState
const [todo, setTodo] = useBlitzState(todoState);
```
